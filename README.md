Technical Writing

A README file is an essential document that provides users with information about a software project, a library, or any other type of project that needs explanation. The README file is usually written in a plain text format, such as Markdown or reStructuredText, although ASCII text is also common.

**Syntax and Structure:**

1. **File Name:** The file should be named `README`, `README.md` (for Markdown), or `README.rst` (for reStructuredText). The `README` should be located at the root of your repository directory.

2. **Start with a Title:**
    ```
    # Project Name
    ```

3. **Project Description:**
    Provide a brief description of what the project is about, what problem it solves, or its purpose.
    ```
    This project is a simple command line tool for managing your daily tasks.
    ```

    **Syntax Note:** For Markdown, use hash symbols to denote headers, with the number of hashes corresponding to the header level.

    - [Installation](#installation)
    - [Usage](#usage)
    - [Contributing](#contributing)
    - [License](#license)
    ```

    **Syntax Note:** This is a Markdown list. Clickable links are created with the `#` followed by the header name.

5. **Features:**
    List out the main features or benefits of using the project. Bullet points are commonly used.
    ```
    - Manage daily tasks
    - Set reminders

    **Syntax Note:** You can link to other files in the repository directly using the file name in brackets and the file name in parenthesis, like `[LICENSE]`(LICENSE).

    You can optionally include contact information, links to related projects, or acknowledgments.
